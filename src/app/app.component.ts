        '<b>Sir Isaac.</b>'  A 20 inch F4.1 classical Dobsonian with Telrad finder and 60mm finderscope. Big, simple and with a light grasp of at least 5000 times that of the unaided eye.</br></br>
        <b>The Alan Longstaff Telescope.</b> A 14 inch fork-mounted Meade LX200 Schmidt Casseagrain. It has a precision Go To function making it easy for complete beginners to find the objects of their choice simply by typing a catalogue number into the handset.</br></br>
        A good collection of  premium TeleVue eyepieces ensures that these telescopes give of their very best.`,

            Les Granges proprietor Olly Penrice is a well known astrophotographer whose picures have been published in Astronomie, Astronomy Now, Sky at Night, Starlight, the SPA journal, the Guardian Online and elsewhere. He has had many forum Pictures of the Week as well as Amateur Astronomy Picture of the Day. He is a frequent contributor to Astronomy Now, mainly reviewing astro-imaging equipment and telescopes. Many Les Granges guests have also had images selected for awards and publication, including Maurice Toetâ€™s contribution to a NASA Astronomy Picture of the Day.</br></br>
            Olly will help you both at the image capture and image processing stages if you wish. It is often possible for complete beginners to produce images of publication quality by the end of a week.</br></br>

            All of this is now more comfortable in our new multi-screen IT and processing room.</br></br>
            This instruction is still free to guests of Les Granges. Some of the more advanced procedures you can learn include layer masking different exposure times for high dynamic range, enhancing colour images with narrowband layers, adding high resolution images to widefield ones from different instruments and creating seamless mosaics.</br></br>

            You can try both one shot colour and monochrome cameras as reviewed in Astronmy Now magazine, for whom Olly wrote a â€˜shoot-outâ€™ comparison.</br></br>

            Before investing in CCD imaging gear a trip to Les Granges could save you a great deal of heartache â€“ and cash! There is a lot to learn but help at the beginning will allow you to move quickly into successful astro-imaging.</br></br>

            For those bringing their own equipment we have four prepared observing sites ready and waiting. Many of our guests do this on a regular basis.</br></br>
            Thanks to Ian King Imaging (<a href="http://www.iankingimaging.com" target="_blank">www.iankingimaging.com</a>) for supplying the equipment and for providing technical support.</br></br>

        Surrounded by hills, the artificial lake feels very natural, though there are picnic tables, barbecues, pedaloes, prepared 'beaches', lawns and a secure swimming area for children.</br>
        It's all free, spacious and very relaxing. Nearby are some wonderful walks and bike rides, too, so you can have some excercise then relax.</br>
        We can fix you up with picnic plates and cool boxes for your day out.`,

            However, the massive stone walls and shuttered windows are well adapted to provide natural cool relief and the altitude eliminates mugginess.</br>

            Autumn is just exquisite with blazing reds, yellows and golds in the vast hillside forests all around.</br>

            Winters tend to be bright and clear but with crisp chilly air and cold clear nights. (The woodburners are great fun, cosy and romantic.)</br>

            We have found that around Easter and again in late October/early November there seems to be the risk of a transition period during which low cloud can sit on the area on and off for a week or two. Astronomers shouldn't forget that, in skies like these, a full moon brings near-daylight conditions all night.</br>
